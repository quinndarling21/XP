# Objective Completion System

## Overview
The objective completion system handles the creation, completion, and management of objectives within pathways. Each objective represents a task that can be completed to earn XP and progress through levels.

## Key Features

### Objective Creation
- Automatic generation of objectives
- XP values between 100-500 (multiples of 10)
- Initial minimum of 10 objectives per pathway
- Completed objectives are preserved for history
- New objectives generated upon completion
- Sequential ordering system
- Optional cadence cycle assignment

### Completion Process
1. Mark objective as completed
2. Award XP to pathway and user
3. Generate new objective while preserving completed ones
4. Update completion statistics
5. Handle level-up if applicable
6. Update cadence progress if part of cycle

### Objective Management
- Maintains history of completed objectives
- Generates new objectives upon completion
- Preserves objective order
- Tracks completion status
- Manages XP distribution

### XP Distribution
- Adds XP to pathway progress
- Updates user's total XP
- Handles level-up scenarios
- Maintains proper state

### Cadence Integration
- Tracks completion within active cycles
- Updates cycle progress
- Maintains cycle integrity
- Handles cycle completion events

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- Core Data updates
- Context refreshing
- Change notifications
- UI updates

### Progress Tracking
- Multiple progress contexts:
  - Individual objective completion
  - Pathway XP and levels
  - Cadence cycle progress
  - User total progression

### Best Practices
- Atomic updates
- Data consistency
- Error recovery
- Performance optimization
