# Cadence Cycle System

## Overview
The Cadence Cycle system allows pathways to have structured, time-based objectives with automatic resets and progress tracking. This system enables users to set specific goals within defined timeframes and track their progress effectively.

## Components

### CadenceFrequency
Defines the timeframe for objective cycles:
- Daily: Resets at midnight local time
- Weekly: Resets on Monday at midnight
- Monthly: Resets on the first of each month at midnight
- None: No structured timeframe (default behavior)

### CadenceCycle Entity
Core Data entity that manages:
- Cycle timeframe and objectives count
- Start and end dates
- Active status
- Relationship to pathway and objectives
- Progress tracking

## Implementation Details

### Cycle Creation
- Created when setting up a pathway with a cadence
- Automatically sets appropriate end date based on frequency
- Maintains one active cycle per pathway
- Initializes with user-defined objective count

### Cycle Management
- Tracks completion status of objectives
- Handles cycle transitions
- Maintains history of previous cycles
- Manages objective generation and assignment

### Integration with Pathways
- Each pathway can have multiple historical cycles
- Only one active cycle at a time
- Convenience relationship for active cycle access
- Automatic cycle creation on pathway setup

## Features

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time completion counting
- Visual progress indicators
- Cycle status monitoring
- Historical data retention

### Automatic Transitions
- End date monitoring
- Cycle expiration handling
- New cycle generation
- Objective reassignment

### Data Management
- Historical cycle preservation
- Objective relationship maintenance
- Active cycle tracking
- Clean state transitions

## Best Practices

### Setting Up Cycles
- Choose appropriate frequency for activity type
- Set realistic objective counts
- Consider user engagement patterns
- Plan for long-term sustainability

### Managing Transitions
- Handle expired cycles gracefully
- Preserve historical data
- Maintain user progress visibility
- Ensure smooth state changes

### Error Handling
- Validate cycle parameters
- Handle edge cases
- Maintain data integrity
- Provide user feedback

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- Custom cycle durations
- Flexible reset times
- Progress notifications
- Achievement tracking
- Statistical analysis
- Cross-pathway coordination

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient data querying
- Memory management
- Background processing
- Cache management
