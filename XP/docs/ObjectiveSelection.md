# Objective Selection System

## Overview
The objective selection system manages which objectives are active during each cadence cycle, ensuring users have a clear set of goals to focus on.

## Key Features

### Objective Assignment
- Selects objectives based on cadence cycle count
- Prioritizes existing incomplete objectives
- Generates new objectives as needed
- Maintains objective order

### Cycle Management
- Tracks objectives through entire cycle
- Preserves completion status
- Handles transitions between cycles
- Maintains historical data

### Selection Process
1. Identify active cycle
2. Find existing incomplete objectives
3. Generate additional objectives if needed
4. Assign to current cycle
5. Save assignments to Core Data

## Implementation Details

### Objective States
- Active in current cycle
- Completed in current cycle
- Outside current cycle
- Historical (completed in past cycles)

### Selection Rules
- Prioritize existing incomplete objectives
- Maintain objective order
- Fill quota with new objectives
- Preserve cycle assignments

### Best Practices
- Clear visual indicators
- Consistent ordering
- Proper state management
- Efficient data access
