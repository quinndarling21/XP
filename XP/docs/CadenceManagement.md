# Cadence Management System

## Overview
The cadence management system enables pathways to have structured, time-based objectives with automatic resets and streak tracking. This system helps users maintain consistent engagement and progress tracking.

## Key Components

### Cadence Configuration
- Frequency options:
  - Daily (resets at midnight)
  - Weekly (resets Monday midnight)
  - Monthly (resets 1st of month)
- Customizable objective count (1-50)
- Automatic cycle creation and management
- Progress tracking and statistics

### Streak System
- Tracks consecutive cycle completions
- Resets on missed cycles
- Maintains completion history
- Validates streak integrity

### Cycle Management
- Automatic cycle transitions
- Objective reassignment
- Progress preservation
- State management
- Clean transitions

### Progress Tracking
- Real-time completion counting
- Progress percentage calculation
- Streak maintenance
- Historical data preservation

## Implementation Details

### Cycle Creation
1. Set frequency and objective count
2. Calculate end date based on frequency
3. Assign initial objectives
4. Initialize tracking state

### Streak Management
1. Track cycle completions
2. Validate completion timing
3. Update streak counter
4. Handle streak breaks
5. Maintain completion history

### Reset Process
1. Detect expired cycles
2. Create new cycle
3. Reassign objectives
4. Preserve completion data
5. Update UI state

### Best Practices
- Regular cycle validation
- Clean state transitions
- Data integrity checks
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

## Testing Coverage
- Cycle creation and initialization
